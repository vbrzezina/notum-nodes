# Magic nodes

## General info

- There are some implemented parts in the source code (mainly React components). For each such part there is a comment that describes the functionality.
- You can continue with the development or you can take it all in a different way. You just need to be able to defend your decision afterwards. The important thing is that the application has all the required features. So,
  - It's up to you how you want to manage state, write css etc...
  - But please, keep [https://tanstack.com/query/v4](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/) as fetching tool.
  - The API is generated and is located together with the API calls and TS interfaces in the `src/api` folder. You just need to call them from your code (and don't forget to turn on the server before that).
  - The [https://mui.com/](https://mui.com/) is installed in the project and it is again up to you whether you want to use it or not. But we recommend to use it, at least you will save time and without UI framework it is almost impossible to develop nowadays.
- The main goal is not so much the design but the cleanliness and quality of the code. In Notum, we use modern react 💪.
- Be creative and show what's in you!
